🚀 **Just shipped my full-stack personal portfolio — built from scratch!**

After investing real time into learning both frontend and backend development, I'm excited to share my personal portfolio project that brings it all together.

---

### 🔧 What I Built

A fully dynamic, API-driven **personal portfolio web application** with a custom admin dashboard — no templates, no page builders, just clean code.

---

### 💻 Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- ⚛️ React 19 + React Router DOM v7
- 🎨 Tailwind CSS — utility-first, fully responsive design
- 🎞️ Framer Motion — smooth page & section animations
- 🔗 Axios — API communication with token-based auth

**Backend**
- 🐘 Laravel 12 (PHP 8.2+) — RESTful API
- 🔐 Laravel Sanctum — secure token authentication
- 🗄️ MySQL — relational database

---

### ✨ Key Features

**Public-Facing Portfolio**
- Hero section with animated intro
- About, Skills, Projects & Testimonials sections
- Contact form — messages sent directly to the database
- Featured projects with live demo & GitHub links

**Admin Dashboard (Protected)**
- Secure login with Sanctum token auth
- Full CRUD for Projects (title, description, tags, images, live/GitHub URLs)
- Full CRUD for Testimonials
- View & manage contact messages with read/unread status

---

### 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

- Fully decoupled frontend & backend (SPA + REST API)
- JWT-style token stored in `localStorage`, injected via Axios interceptors
- Role-protected admin routes on both frontend and API level
- Clean MVC structure on the backend with dedicated API controllers

---
